This program was tested to run on wsl or linux.

If pandas, matplotlib, or numpy are not already installed, you will need to run this command:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```
Note: This program expects the file called "linear_regression_data.csv" to be in the same directory as the python code running.
Then, run our program with this command:
```bash
python3 problem1.py
```
With the data ("linear_regression_data.csv") provided from Canvas, the program should print the following:
```
Slope (m): 2.770143943072809
y-Intercept (b): 4.215178247449777
```
The program should also produce an image file called "linear_regression_plot.png" within the same directory as the code running. You can then open the image with any tool that you choose (eom, photos, any default windows apps).
